## Objective

On May 7, 2010 - [Vanity Fair published an article](http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2010/05/the-names-of-the-characters-in-twilight-have-invaded-most-popular-baby-names-ranking) that pointed out characters from a popular book/movie series *Twilight* appear in the [Social Security Administration's annual list of most popular baby names](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/). 

In 2010, Isabella and Jacob (both characters from the famous Twilight movie novelizations/novelized movies) were #1 on girls and boys charts. Four years later, [Vanity Fair writes that Jacob has been dethroned by Noah and Liam](http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2014/05/jacob-dethroned-most-popular-baby-name-2013). On the female side, the top six female names all end with the letter 'a'. The author suggests that some of these names may be an influenced by celebrity baby names. 

Research Question: Could it be that parents find inspiration for children names from pop cultural references?
