Steps Involved
---

1. **Data collection** - Create a scraper for downloading lyrics for each album. This should only take 1 python file that contains that downloads lyrics from RapGenius.
	- Output:  A directory named 'lyrics' that contains text files. Each file will be named with year then title. For example, `2007-Hello-Brooklyn.txt`.
2. **Data analysis** - Tokenize words and count each mention of a brand name. This should be 1 python file that reads the lyric text files and outputs a comma separated file described below.
	- Output: A comma separated file (CSV) that contains three columns: year, brand, frequency.
	- Resources: [Natural Language Processing with Python](http://www.nltk.org/book/) Book
3. **Data Visualization** - Plot data as a two-axis chart. A script that reads the CSV file and outputs a two axis chart. 
	- Output: an image file with the chart correctly annotated.


Python Libraries
---

### Setup and Installation: 

[@katychuang](http://github.com/katychuang) prepared a requirements.txt file that you can use to install needed libraries with pip. To use this, create a virtual environment and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Note: 

In order to run the tokenizing script, you'll need to download the stop words copora from NLTK. You can do that with this command `python -c "import nltk; nltk.download()"`
