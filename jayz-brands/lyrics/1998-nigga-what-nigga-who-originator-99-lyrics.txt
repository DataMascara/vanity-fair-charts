Nigga what, nigga who
Nigga what, nigga who
Switcha flow, getcha dough
Can't fuck with this Roc-a-Fella shit doe
Switcha flow, getcha dough
Can't fuck with this Roc-a-Fella shit doe

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit em with numerous
Shots with the fo'-fo'
Faggots wanna talk to po-po's
Smoke em like cocoa
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload
Fuck that on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed
Left holes through some guy clothes
Stop your bullshit
Glock with the full clip
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip
See the nigga laying shocked when the bullet hit
Oh hey ma, how you know niggas wanna buy you
But see me I wanna fuck for free like Akinyele
Take this ride, make you feel it inside your belly
If it's tight get the K-Y Jelly
All night get you wide up inside the telly
Side to side, til you say Jay Z you're too much for me

[Hook]

(Nigga what?) Make you think you can fuck with me
(Nigga who?) Recognize girl, Jay to the Z
(Nigga what?) Make you think you can fuck with me
(Nigga who?) Recognize girl, Jay to the Z
(Nigga what?) Make you think you can fuck with me
(Nigga who?) Recognize girl, Jay to the Z
(Nigga what?) Make you think you can fuck with me
(Nigga who?) Recognize bitch, Jay to the motherfuckin' Z

[Verse 2]
Got a condo with nothing but condoms in it
The same place where the rhymes is invented
So all I do is rap and sex imagine how I stroke
See how I was flowing on my last cassette
Rapid-fire like I'm blasting a Tec, never jam though
Never get hot, never run out of ammo
Niggas hating and shit cause I slayed your bitch
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick
And now you're, acting raw but you never had war
Don't know how to carry your ho, wanna marry your ho
Now she's mad at me cause Your Majesty
Just happened to be a pimp - what a tragedy
She wanted, us to end cause I fucked her friends
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again
I seen her tears as she busted in
I said shit
There's a draft
Shut the door bitch and come on in

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Got a vendetta even though I been better
Left him in the cold with a thin sweater
Rap niggas on Prozac get the bozack, niggas threw
Two at me I threw fo' back, hold that
Let the dough stack
Way before Big had the gold Ac
Dame had the Lex black
Motherfuckers wanna test that, stress that
And right where you're stressed at, where you rest at
I suggest that niggas invest in a vest when I come through
With the Glock jet black you niggas step back
I'm the best at you know I ain't no apprentice to this
Me and my niggas we invented the shit
I came into the business with this
The Originator, none greater
Jaz-O finish this shit

[Verse 4 - Big Jaz]
Better learn
Jaz'll relax that, ever heard of me
Worldwide Originator say word to me
The population holla certainly
I burn a nigga like a third degree
See me shine so bright
Nigga I'm my light, running ruling with rigor and vigor
Nobody bigger than me and my nigga Jigga
You fly-by-nights stop chirpin B
Heavyweight's light work for me
For the time in this motherfucker ain't nobody hurting me
What, cut your face in like surgery
Who the fuck got a VS
Fucking BM's on the road
When you had to be in bed at the PM
Need the info, Jaz on the C-N-N
Forever touching my work is beginning youâ€™re endin
Nigga your style's no style my style's hostile
C'mon, faggot nigga down to take the gun home
The O-RI-GI-NA-TOR
Can't fuck with it can you

[Hook]

[Refrain x3]
Switcha flow, getcha dough
Can't fuck with this Roc-a-Fella shit doe
Switcha flow, getcha dough
Can't fuck with this Roc-a-Fella shit doe
