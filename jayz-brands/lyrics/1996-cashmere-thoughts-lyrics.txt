[Verse 1]
I talk jewels and spit diamonds: all cherry
Like a hymen, when I'm rhyming with remarkable timing
Caviar and silk dreams, my voice is linen
Spitting venom up in the minds of young women
Mink thoughts to think thoughts type similar
Might you remember, my shit is cold like December
Smoother than Persian rugs, the cashmere
Chromosomes make a nigga Jigga - Jay-Z, lethal drugs
18-carat gold pen, when it hits the sheets
Words worth a million like I'm rapping them through platinum teeth
I got the Grey Poupon, you been warned
Cause all beef return well done filet mignon
The Don, smell of Dom on my breath as I
Yawn, (slow) when you hoes try to con a pro
As if you didn't know, Jay's about getting dough
Spitting flow like fine wines down your earlobe
I'm smooth but deadly like a pearl handled pistol
Honeys hum in melody when I rub it like crystal
The proper etiquette, when I drop the subject verb
Then the predicate, with this rich nigga rhetoric
I'm solid gold, I rap like a mink stole
I stick pearl tongues your world will never know
From New York to Paris, the vocal style vary
From nice to deadly like a bad bag of D, Now
Notice the child swift like a Lotus
Focus on the loc' I be the greatest nigga that wrote it
Return of the Jedi, from Rio De Janeiro on the red eye
Yet I still feel the need to be fly
I did die when I'm rapping then slide like satin
You know the black I white china in the brain cabinet
I never cry if I did I'd cry ice
From my nigga Sauce, I hit you with this advice
Life's short, so play hard and stick hard
And the only time you love them is when your dick hard

[Verse 2]
Ghetto's Errol Flynn, hot like heroin
Young pimps is sterile when I pimp through your borough and
I gotta keep your tricks intact
Cause I walk like a pimp, talk like a mack, man
The star player, the golden bar layer
The sweet Ms. Fine Thing player, sure you're right
I'm game tight, so watch it'll change the night
Go tell your peeps dog I'm lethal until it ain't right
I pimp hard on a trick: look
Fuck if your leg broke bitch, hop up on your good foot
