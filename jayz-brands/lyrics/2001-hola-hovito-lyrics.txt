[Intro]
Ah, ch-ch-cha
It's that hop I'm talking about right here Timbo!
I can't be stopped when it hop like this family, uh!
(Uno, dos, tres, cuatro!)

[Verse 1]
They say "Hola Hovito!"
That's what they saying when I roll up with my people
My music banging like - them vatos locos got rap in a choke hold
And I won't surrender it with beats by Timbaland
Callate la boca, my baby
All I want to do is stroke you all crazy
My dick game is vicious, insane at bitches
Mami keep coming back cause mami came vicious
Catch Hov' in the drop, nasty thang, lane switching
Once you turn your neck for a sec, your dame's missing
"Bujando, bujando!" - the cops is coming
Got that rap patrol behind, yo: get to running
I'm unstoppable Hov', untoppable flows
I'm the compadre, the Sinatra of my day
Ol' Blue Eyes my nigga, "I did it my way"
If y'all not rolling with Hov' then hit the highway

[Hook]
"Hola Hovito!" Yeah, yeah "Hola Hovito!"
Yeah that's what they saying when that music get to banging
Put it down for my people

[Verse 2]
Naw, I don't fuck around, stay on my J.O.-
Hov' been about that dough since I was a day old
Oh, push perico if I need to for the Root of Evil
Was born in the belly: that's the way the streets breed you
One life to live - notice you get no sequel
So I truly got to live this like my last movie
6 oohie, jewels dripping, big tooly
I ball for real: y'all niggas is Sam Bowie
And with the third pick, I made the earth sick
M.J., him Jay, fade-away, perfect
I rhyme sicker than every rhyme-spitter
Every crime-nigga that rhyme or touch a mic
Because my mind's quicker
I'm a '88er, 9-6 to "Reasonable Doubt"
Temper short; don't take much to squeeze you out
Yeah you shining, but the only thing you're leaving out
You're a candle in the sun - that shit don't even out

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hold up; naw muh'fuckers - y'all muh'fuckers
Better run to the post office and get a job, muh'fuckers
Or starve muh'fuckers, cause Jay's been the only one
Eating thus far, sub-par muh'fuckers
Naw even though y'all hate, I love y'all muh'fuckers
"Friend or Foe" y'all all my muh'fuckers
If you haven't heard, I'm Michael, Magic and Bird
All rolled in one - cause none got more flows than Young
Plus got more flows to come
And if I ain't better than Big, I'm the closest one
So move over - hoes, choose Hova
My food for thought so hot it give you dudes ulcers
Rovers, roasters, poseurs
Getting it in with me, living like they supposed to
Watches, chain, front row at the game
Sold out arena, all screaming my name, c'mon!
