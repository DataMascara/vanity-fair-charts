[Verse One: Jay-Z]
Peep the scripts, scoped honey from the whip
Jumped out like YO! Who the fuck you with?
Flash the jewels cause that's the rule
Damn I like a girl who spend a little cash for her shoes
Face natural - can I get at you?
Saw a spot on the body look nice with a tattoo
With my name, but didn't want to jump the gun
I didn't know how many niggas was humping hon
I said I never seen a face like yours before
And I been around some cute whores before
That either me or my boys tore it up before
So I'm hoping you different
Let you push the 6
And give you a different life and
Baby if it's right jump on it in the morning
And ride it 'til the night
Want to buy you real jewelry when it hits the light
Bitches'll momentarily lose they sight
She said

[Hook]
I know what boys like
I know what they want
I know what boys like, boys like
I know what boys like
I know what they want
I know what boys like, boys like me

[Verse Two: Lil' Kim]
You want a cutie with a booty like POW!
Deeper than a MILE! Earrings shine like TADOW!
But I'm a real bitch so you know I do real things
Only real bitches live like queens - Get it?
Safety deposit in the walk-in closet
Marvel Forts is for matching Rolls Royce's
In the driveway from Monday to Friday
I be the richest, shitting on these bitches
While chickens cluck giving up the butt
I plays the cut with the Daddy Warbucks
You can call me a slut, who gives a fuck
That's fine nigga shit, I'm a good with mine
I can tell by your shoes you know what I want
Fuck a pre-nup give me half up front
My sex be the best so we split these costs
You can stop saying mine
And start saying ours

[Hook]
I know what girls like
I know what they want
They want to sex me
They think I'm sexy
I know what girls like, girls like me

I know what boys like
I know what they want
They want to sex me
They think I'm sexy
I know what boys like, boys like me

[Verse Three: Jay-Z]
Got the bomb place, fireplace John Blaze
Victoria Secret lingerie, ice like Don King
The price was like eight digits a long way, shit
Got the beachfront view, V1 too
Cop you one cop me one too
On the place, jet ski's park by the lake
No neighbors, make all the noise you want to make
Invite your friends over
Let 'em make their way through the Benz's and the Rovers
Before they reach the door
Vacate, hey wait, a week or more
First class to and fro, freakin off
Got to have things locked, champagne popped
Cruise around the world 'til the damn thing stop
Cop Rembrandt, hang 'em, pay the lot
Can't complain, we ballin, true or not ma?

[Hook: 2x]
I know what girls like
I know what they want
I know what girls like, girls like
I know what girls like
I know what they want
I know what girls like, girls like me

I know what boys like
I know what they want
I know what boys like, boys like
I know what boys like
I know what they want
I know what boys like, boys like me
