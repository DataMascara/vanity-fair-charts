[Hook: Beyonc√©]
We gonna take it to the moon, take it to the stars
How many people you know can take it this far?
I'm supercharged, we about to take this whole thing to Mars
Now we gonna take it to the moon, take it to the stars
We don't know what we could do to make it this far
So many scars, we about to take this whole thing to Mars

[Verse 1: Kanye]
Lift off, lift off, takin' my coat off
Showing my tattoos, I'm such a show off, huh
I feel the pain and then roll off
I got the whole city, they about to go off
How many niggas with me up and in the aisle?
How many people want to roll on me now?
Like you know na na na, you know me by now
Know me, know me by now

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye]
Lift off, like you know na na na
You know me by now, know me, know me by now
You know me know me by now, know me, know me by now

[Jay-Z]
Lift off
Rappers hear Watch the Throne, they gon' be pissed off
Earth is boring to 'em, shit is making my dick soft
When you Earnhart as me eventually you hit a big wall
5-4-3-2 we need fuel, lift off

[Hook]

[Outro]
20 seconds and counting
T minus 15 seconds, guidance is internal
12, 11, 10, 9, ignition sequence start
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, all engines running
Lift off, we have a lift off, lift off
