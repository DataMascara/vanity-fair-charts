[Hook]
(Na na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye)
Only rapper to rewrite history without a pen
No I.D. on the track let the story begin, begin, begin

[Verse 1]
This is anti-auto-tune, death of the ringtone
This ain’t for iTunes, this ain’t for sing-alongs
This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song
Wrong, this ain't politically correct
This might offend my political connects
My raps don’t have melodies
This should make niggas wan' go and commit felonies
Get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I’m so Brooklyn!
I know we facing a recession
But the music y’all making gon' make it the Great Depression
All y’all lack aggressionn
Put your skirt back down, grow a set man
Nigga this shit violent
This is death of auto-tune, moment of silence

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
This ain’t a number one record
This is practically assault with a deadly weapon
I made this just for Flex and
Mister Cee I want niggas to feel threatened
Stop your bloodclot crying
The kid, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
You niggas' jeans too tight
You colors too bright, your voice too light (too far nigga)
I might wear black for a year straight
I might bring back Versace shades
This ain’t for Z100
Ye told me to kill y’all to keep it a hundred
This is for Hot 9-7
This shit for Clue, for Khaled we the best’n
Aww, nigga this shit violent
This is death of auto-tune, moment of silence

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hold up, this shit need a verse from Jeezy
I might send this to the mixtape Weezy
Get somebody from BMF to talk on this
Get this to a Blood, let a Crip walk on it
3 Thou' to style on this
I just don’t need nobody to smile on this
You niggas singing too much
Get back to rap, you T-Paining too much
I’m a multi-millionaire
So how is it I’m still the hardest nigga here
I don’t be in the project hallway
Talking 'bout how I be in the project all day
That sound stupid to me
If you a gangsta this is how you prove it to me
Nigga just get violent
This is death of auto-tune, moment of silence

(Na na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye)
