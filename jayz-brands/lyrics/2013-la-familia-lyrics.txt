Let's get back to this dinero

[Verse 1]
Niggas wanna kidnap wifey
Good luck with that bruh
You must gonna hide your whole family
What you think we wearing black for
Ready for that war, ready for that war, ready
You ain't ready yo, you radio, you ain't really ready
Real shit chyea, Alpo bought his bricks here
Elvis got his records took, it's like we got our seventh gear
NFL investigations, oh, don't make me laugh
FBI investigation, we stood up to that
Facts only, everything real in my raps only
Every nigga real in my clique really
Everyone's a movie star you got to film me
La familia

[Verse 2]
My brothers is my brother like my brother is
My niggas is my brother like my mother kids
Not just in good times, that's that sucka shit
But in war times, it's just what it is
Head of the family, all my niggas bosses though
Y'all don't understand we? We talk that shit bosses know
Triple fuckin' OG, what's up to my nigga Juan
Tell these niggas pull their fuckin' skirt down, I could see their ovaries
Niggas snitching switching teams, out here telling bitches things
Industry talk behind your back, ain't nobody got time for that
Facts only, everything real in my raps only
Every nigga real in my clique really
Even the girls keep it two hundred and trilly
It's la familia
