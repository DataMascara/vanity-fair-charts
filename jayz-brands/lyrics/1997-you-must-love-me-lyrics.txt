[Intro: Kelly Price]
Throughout my life
No matter what I've done
You've been merciful and your love endureth
Through all things
For that I am eternally grateful

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Since my date of birth bought you nothing but hurt
Play those video games, stole change from ya purse
Sat on the cold court bench 'til I was arraigned in ya skirt
Saw the pain in ya face through you maintained a smirk
All you did was motivate me "don't let 'em hold you back"
What I do I turned around and I sold you crack
I was a bastard for that, Still I'm drowning in shame
Just remember one thing now you're not to blame
You was newly separated tryin' to escape ya world
And through my thirst I didn't help you I just made things worse
I hated me and everybody that created crack
Had me thinkin' the newest kicks and the latest gat
Still haven't apologized, so please play this back
While I try to come to terms with such a heinous act
You know in more than one way cocaine numbs the brain
All I did was think about how the funds once came
Then I ran across this memory and it stung the brain
How can you ever destroy the beauty from which one came
That's a savage you're the reason why me and these beats make a marriage
Why I rhyme above average and I ain't shit
Glad you got yourself together. No thanks to me
Strong and beautiful the way thangs should be
You must love me

[Hook: Kelly Price]
You must love me...
Say that you love me
All I know say that you must love me
Ohh yeah

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
We used to fight every night but I never would suffer
Just smile my big brother's Tryna make me tougher
As we grew fussing and fighting continued
As I plundered through ya stuff and snuck ya clothes to school
Got intense real intense as we got older
Never believed it would lead to me poppin' one in your shoulder
Where my rings? Knew you had it cause you took too long
As Mickey, Annie and the girl that bought it looked on
Huffin' and puffin' gun in my hand Told you step outside
Hoping you said no but you hurt my pride
Made our way down the steps Maybe you thought it was just a threat
Or maybe ya life was just that crazy and you was beggin' for death
Try to justify this in my young mind but the adrenaline
And my ego hurt combined Drove me berzerk
Saw the devil in your eyes, high off more than weed
Confused I just closed my young eyes and squeezed
What a sound! Opened my eyes just in time to see ya stumbling to the ground
Damn! what the fuck I done now?
Runnin' around in a circle thinking I'm assed out
Hot gun burnin' my waist, ran straight to Jaz' house
Like a stranger damn I just shot my nigga
And ran off into the night as if it was not my nigga
Left the scene. How could I go out that way?
Still you asked to see me in the hospital ya next day
You must love me

[Hook: Kelly Price]
You must love me...
What after all the wrong I've done
I know you must

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Everything in my power and within my frame
To protect you from this life and keep you away from the game
But you was one of the few people that I can trust
And the fact of the matter I slang these pies for us
You put the pressure on me daily, rarely would you let it go
Was a thousand and one times I had to tell you no
When it was one of those days when nobody was around
And I needed emergency trip out of town
Searched my mental rolodex for all the numbers I know
As you stared in my face asking me could you go
I'm agreed said sender everything'll go smooth
Just tell her what to do and everything'll go through
Strapped her body with them thangs as you boarded the plane
Couldn't explain these strange feelings that I caught and the pain
I'm thinkin' why would I send you when I knew it ain't right
I'm thinkin' what would make you sacrifice ya life
You must love me

[Hook: Kelly Price]
(You must love me repeats in background)
After everything that I've done wrong
I know inside you must love me
I know that you love me
You showed me I know it
I know
Say that you love me
Say that you love me
I know you must love me
Oh yes you do
Inside I know it
You've always shown it
You love me yea yeah
Oh yeah
I know that you love me
