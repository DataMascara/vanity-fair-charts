[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
You used to all the attention, huh
But you don't want no commitment, huh
Why not, you should be coming home with me
Sitting in this lap with the luxury
Now you be, coming home while I'm waking up
Actin like you behave and stuff
Uh-huh, you should be coming home with me
Sittin' in this lap with the luxury, now check it

[Verse 1: Jay-Z] + (Pharrell)
Yes, a lime to a lemon, my V-A women
Walk in Manolo Blahniks cause my condo with elevators in em
She wanna wrinkle my linens
So I sprinkle her with gin and then we begin sinning
Blasphemy, oh my God, every sentence
She keeps scratching me like she have tiger in her
This is exact-a-ly, why I had to pin her
To the bed like a wres-tl-er, had to pretzel her
Her man kept paging, stressing her
So I told her what to say just in case he question her
(Situations will arise, but you gotta be smart about it)
No matter what you do, don't talk about us
Don't give him no info, he'll be lost without it
Just keep your mouth shut, we could do this again
Bring a friend

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Jay-Z]
Guess who's back in my motherfucking house
Half black, half white chick; I call her Minnie Mouse
Whoo, we always hook up when we out
We do what we like to do and then we out
But lately I've been having the strangest feelings
Your boy Young Hov catching feelings
And it's messing up my dealings cause mami's not willing
To leave her boyfriend, she call me her toy-friend
Said, we was just 'sposed to hook up and have a blast
She called me her emergency dick-in-a-glass
Hehehe I had to laugh for a second
Had to check myself, get my macking back in perspective
I slack for a second but I'm back, no question
Like I walk with a cane, Ain't No Half-Steppin
Jeah, and on that note
Iceberg Slim is back to rock a boat, c'mon
