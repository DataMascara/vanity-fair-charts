The other night when I was researching what was going to be discussed today I came across a passage wrote down, I think it really simplifies what the human administrative is talking about and I learned that all things must come to an end, it is an inevitable part of the cycle of resistance, all things must conclude
Take the analogy of a tree that grows in Brooklyn among the steel and the concrete with all its glorious branches and leaves, one day it too will pass on its legacy through the seeds it dropped to the ground and as the wind carries these seeds throughout wherever they might move a new life will begin for each one of them as they stand as a monument to the one that came before

That came before
That came before
That came before
That came before...
