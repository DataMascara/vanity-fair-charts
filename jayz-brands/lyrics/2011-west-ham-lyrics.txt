[Verse 1: Kanye West]
It was all good just a week ago, niggas feel theyselves
And that Watch the Throne drop, niggas kill themselves
What are niggas gon' do, Hov? This a new crack on a new stove
I'm in the two-door, true that, niggas telling me "You back!"
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?
And if life's a bitch, bet she suck my dick, huh
And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh
By the way nigga you should fucking quit nigga
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it
Like Eli, I did it, joke's on you motherfucker, and I get it
No paper ho, but you can have some more of me
Or-a-gy or are we speaking metaphorically?
Historically I'm kicking bitches out like Pam, nigga
Going H·A·M nigga, me and Jigga
And a nigga still young, wanna have no kids
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
Had a few white girls, asses flat as shit
But the head's so good, damn a nigga glad he hit
Got 'em jumping out the building, watch out below
A million out the door, I'm about to go H·A·M

[Hook]
Hard as a motherfucker
Let these niggas know who I am
I'm about to go H·A·M
Hard as a motherfucker
Let these niggas know who I am

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Fuck y'all mad at me for?
Y'all don't even know what I've been through
I played chicken with a Mack truck
Y'all muthafuckas woulda been moved
I swam waters with Great Whites
Y'all muthafuckas woulda been chewed
I hustled with vultures late nights
Y'all muthafuckas woulda been food
Fuck wrong with these dudes? Try to walk around in these shoes
See the shit I saw growing up
Then maybe you could take a peek at Bey’s boobs
Niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily
Like these rappers rap about all the shit that I do really
I'm like "Really: half a billi nigga, really?" you got baby money
Keep it real with niggas, niggas ain't got my lady's money
Watch the throne, don't step on our robe
Bad enough we let you step on our globe
With my nephew die, daddy dead
Nigga took the price on my uncle's head
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled
So I feel like I would like to know my uncle's bread
Bow down, brother pay homage
Don't spill hate, all on my garments
Comme des Garcons, fuck yo fresh
Headshots nigga, fuck your vest
Fuck the pigs, no pork on my fork
Peace God, cause you know a nigga just went H·A·M
