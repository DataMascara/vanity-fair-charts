[Intro: Notorious B.I.G. in a 1996 MTV interview]
Gotta try to stay above water y'know
Just stay busy, stay working
Puff told me like
The key to this joint
The key to staying on top of things
Is treat everything like it's your first project, nomsayin'
Like it's your first day like back when you was an intern
Like, that's how you try to treat things like, just stay hungry

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Y'all wanna know why he don't stop
Y'all wanna know why he don't flop
Let me tell you pe-people why
Came from the bottom of the block I
When I was born, it was sworn, I was never gon' be shit
Had to pull the opposite out this bitch
Had to get my ri-ide on
Eyes on the prize, Shawn knew I had to
Had to had to get these chips
Had to make moves like Olajuwon
Started out selling dimes and nicks
Graduated to a brick
No exaggeration, my infatuation with the strip
Legendary like a schoolboy
Crushin' merely nearly every every chick
Heavy shit - that's how schoolboy got whipped
And got left on some, Just Me, Myself and I
On some Trugoy shit
Had your boys threw place up
To a place of no return
Had to play with fire and get burned
Only way the boy ever gon' learn
Had to lay way in the cut, til I finally got my turn
Now I'm on top in the spot that I earned

[Hook]
It's my life
It's my pain and my struggle
The song that I sing to you is my everything
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
And my thirst is the same as when I came
It's my joy and my tears and the laughter it brings to me
It's my everything

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Like I never rode in a limo
Like I just dropped flows to a demo
Like it's ninety-two again and
And I got O's in the rental
Back in the Stu' again
No prob' living was a whole lot simple
When you think back, you thought that
You would never make it this far, then you
Take advantage of the luck you handed
Or the talent, you been given
Ain't no, half stepping, ain't no, no slipping
Ain't no different from a block that's hitting
Gotta get it while the getting's good
Gotta strike while the iron's hot, before you stop
Then you gotta bid it, good riddance
Goodbye, this is my second major breakup
My first was, with a pager
With a hooptie, a cookpot, and the GAME
This one's with the stu', with the stage, with the fortune
Maybe not the fortune, but certainly the FAME

[Hook]
