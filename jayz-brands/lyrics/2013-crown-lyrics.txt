[Intro: Sizzla]
They can't keep a good man down
Always keep a smile when they want me to frowns
Keep the vibes and they stood my grounds
They will never ever take my crown
Who Jah bless I say no man curse
Things gettin' better when they thought it would be worse
Here comes the officers askin' for a search
They found no weapon just only a draw of herbs

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
You in the presence of a king
Scratch that, you in the presence of a God
Put in the belly of the beast
I escaped, a nigga never had a job
Scott Boras, you over baby
Robinson Cano, you coming with me
These niggas like rotary phones
It's a new day, hit up KD
Niggas always try to knock a nigga down
Knock me to my knees about a million times
Uncle said I'll never sell a million records
I sold a million records like a million times
These niggas shouldn't let me in
I ball so hard on ESPN
See my name come across on CNN
'bout 6 minutes, you gonna see it again
'bout 6 minutes, you gonna see me again

[Hook: Travis Scott]
Shit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me
I was left for dead, they tried to wipe me out of your history
Shit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me
I was left for dead, they tried to wipe me out of they history

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
If Fear is your only God
Get y'all to fear me is my only job
Crown, crown
Crown, crown

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Bulletproof glass, glass roof like the Pope
Bulletproof love, niggas down since the yolk
Bitch asked if I was God, fuck I'm supposed to say no?
You already seen me turn a man to a G.O.A.T
You already know what I could do with the coke
Dropped it in the water, made it disappear
I made it reappear, I had that bitch on a rope
I make my roof get ghost, bottom grill, I make my tooth get gold
All the shit I did, I wasn't supposed to live, Hallelujah Hov
Wasn't for the 'caine wouldn't be able
Wasn't for the bread, probably be dead
Best friends become ya enemies, niggas' knives are double-edged

[Hook]
