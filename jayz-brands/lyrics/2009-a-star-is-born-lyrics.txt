[Hook]
Every day a star is born (And you say New York City!)
Clap for em, clap for em, clap for em
Every day a star is born
Clap for em, clap for em, clap for em
Hey!

[Verse 1 - Jay-Z]
I seen Mase do it, I seen Ye do it
X came through, caught lighter fluid
Still I came through it
Clap for em
But I’m the blueprint
I’m like the map for em
I dropped another classic
Made Puff pass it
Nobody could touch Puff back when Puff had it
Wayne scorching, I'll applaud him
If he keep going, pass the torch to him
50 came through like hurricanes do
I thought I'd finish his ass at Summer Jam too
I had the Illmatic on bootleg
The shit was so ahead, thought we was all dead
Wayne did A Milli, 50 did a milli
Ye too, but what Em did was silly
The white boy blossomed after Dre endorsed him
His flow on Renegade, fucking awesome
Applaud him

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Jay-Z]
Snoop dogged it, Nelly came down
The Face Mob, kept it ghetto for the H town
Luda moved digits after he moved bitches
Drake’s up next, see what he do with it
Rule had a run, couple movie parts
T.I. literally wanted to shoot up the charts
What up Jeezy, what it do
Y’all remind me of us in early '92
Outkast landed, 3 thou was ill
Like a male version of Lauryn Hill
Mobb Deep shook it but Prodigy took it a lil' too far
Can’t fuck with Brooklyn
Wu-Tang gangbanged it, Meth ate
Rae took on the date with the Purple Tape
Passed on to Ason and then Ghostface
They had a hell of a run
Standing ovate, ayyy

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Jay-Z]
And I am one of one
Can’t you see just how long my run
My reign Lulu's son shine
Been a star since I was back in one time
One time give it up for him
December 4th a star was born
Clap for him
He went from moving that corner
To this corner office is so enormous
Hey, Pres Carter
Watch them get they Monica on all day
Hey
Got so many different monikers but only 1 Jay
They come, they go
Some real, some faux
Some friends, some hoes
But no, I goes nowhere, this Hov

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - J. Cole]
And could I be a star
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life
Just to make it in these Broadway lights?
Now shining in the broad day light, go figure
A slow transition from a little broke nigga from the Ville
Got a deal, a real life saver
Dreams of being behind the wheel like Jada
I chill now...cop a little ice later
Cole you got the glow like a lil' lightsaber
So clap for him, then applaud Hov
He gave him a platform
Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him
No sir
The flow's cold as a shoulder
Of gold digging hoes when a broke nigga approaches
Told ya I’m focused man
I’ll let you motherfuckers soak it in
