[Kanye West]
How much they hate it? very!
Kiss girls like Katy Perry
I am never sprung, but I Spring 'er, Jerry
Don’t try this at home: results may vary
King like T.I., but in the Chi, Larry...

[Jay-Z]
Hoover, Hova
Both are American Gangsters
You choose who's colder
Rappers get nasty in the booth but I'm grosser
I can’t even stomach myself, ulcer!
More realer cause I’m closer
Had girlies in girdles weighing more than they supposed to
Poser, no sir
My hustle, so Russell
I stretch work, yoga
You know I got it down, dog
Al Roker, I used to knock pounds off
It ain’t nothing for me to knock some nouns off
At these MC’s praying for my downfall
They just haters, I wave at you
I’m so player
I’ll never be done, I’m so rare

[Kanye West]
We killing the game, it's not fair
You muthafuckers stay right there
Cause we too high up in the air
We blasting off just like a laser
Nigga, pee-une, pee-une, pee-une
Get back, gimme room room room
DB9 like vroom, vroom, vroom
Young Hov, what we doin, doin, doin?

[Jay-Z]
We ballin', bitches
Eating ya'll food leaving dishes
Why these niggas always talking Lear talk, 'Ye?
Why I never see em at the Clearport, 'Ye?
Why always hear they at the airport?
While I fly daily like I’m in the Air Force?
Therefore, please stop talking my ears off
Millionaire talk
You haters, you mad at me cause your paper
Need to get its motherfucking weight up
Hold up
Wait up, I ain’t done
Name one thing I ain’t done
It hurts when you say that I ain't the one
You haters
How do I gain your favor
I need to know cause I care
I need you to love me, I swear, look here!
See 'Ye is running the Chi like Gale Sayers
I'm running New York, I got the mayor on my pager
You can’t fade us, you haters
I need you, stay there
I breathe you like air
Yeah-yuh, yeah-yeah-yeah yeah-yuh
