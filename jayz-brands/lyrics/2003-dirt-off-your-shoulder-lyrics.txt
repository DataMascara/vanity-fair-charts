You're now tuned into the muh'fuckin greatest
Turn the music up in the headphones
Tim, you can go and brush your shoulder off nigga
I got you, yeah

[Hook]
If you feeling like a pimp, nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 1]
I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
Tryin to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feeling no remorse, feeling like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, gripping my balls
Said the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screaming
All the ballers is bouncing, they like the way I be leaning
All the rappers be hating off the track that I'm making
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back nigga cause I'm straight with the Roc

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Your homey Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, trying to get me a Rover
Trying to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya
But like, 52 cards went out, I'm through dealing
Now 52 bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now, 52 cars roll out, remove ceiling
In case 52 broads come out, now you chilling
With a boss, bitch of course, S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Your boy back in the building, Brooklyn we back on the map
Me and my beautiful bee-itch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em, niggas scared of that black
I drop that Black Album then I back out it
As the best rapper alive, nigga ask about me
From Bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammys
From O's to opposite of Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay, for selling out the Garden in a day
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey'
I'm a hustler homie, you a customer crony
Got some dirt on my shoulder; could you brush it off for me?
