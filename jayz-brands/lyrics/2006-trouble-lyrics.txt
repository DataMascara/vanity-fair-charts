[Intro:]
I done gotten in Trouble again

[Jay-Z]
What the fuck
I tried man, I'm back
Peace to [?]

I done gotten in Trouble again

[Hook: Jay-Z]
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end we're all the same (All the same)
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga I'm never gonna change (Gonna change)
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end we're all the same (All the same)
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga I'm never gonna change (Gonna change)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Now the singer Rob calls the police on me
Y'all niggas ran out and copped the CD
See what I discovered is y'all snitch lovers
I might speak, but I don't fuck with nobody
See what Doug, Jimmy & L.A. don't know
These young'uns crossed the line with Hov, I'm lettin' it blow
Had the papers writing stories like: "Didn't they know?
This what happen when they made that rapper CEO"
I know, its just a matter of time before the steady hate
Starts to overflow, then the levee breaks
And my conscience go, "You escaped the RICO
Why throw everything away over ego?"
You paper chasin', they paper hatin'
Billionaire Hov, you on the pace to make it
Fuck that, exclamation, comma
Quotation's "I love drama", period

[Hook: Jay-Z]
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end we're all the same (All the same)
I pray to god, father forgive a nigga I'm never gonna change (Never gonna change)
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end we're all the same (All the same)
I pray to god, father forgive a nigga I'm never gonna change (Never gonna change)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Smelling like Patron, singing dirty rap songs
Tip-toeing in the crib like six in the morn'
Everyday it's the same
I said in Blueprint that I'd never change, it's just a part of the game
Respect me I'm a thug, I might cool out for a sec
But expect me to bug, it's in my blood
But if my chick leave me she gon' leave me for something
She gon' leave me cause Halle, she ain't gon' leave me for nothing
Picture me gettin up with something sleazy
Something, something, so easy
You could take out of Speed like nothing
Soon as you finish cuttin', you like, "leave me please"
Not me, I need Angelina Jolizeey comfort
So I ain't gon' make a move unless I got a Plan B
That'll happen the day I have a baby by Free
Not to say that anything is wrong with Free
Just to say that ain't nothing wrong with me
If my hand's in the cookie jar, know one thing
I'mma take the cookie, not leave my ring
If my hands in the cookie jar know one thing
I'mma take (laughs) y'all know what I mean

[Hook: Jay-Z]
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end we're all the same (All the same)
I pray to god, father forgive a nigga I'm never gonna change (Never gonna change)
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end we're all the same (All the same)
I pray to god, father forgive a nigga I'm never gonna change (Never gonna change)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Unh
You little niggas ain't deep you dumb
You niggas ain't gangsta, you gum, I chew lil' niggas
Hock-too, spew lil' niggas
I can only view lil'niggas like lil' niggas
But in lieu of lil' niggas trying to play that boy
I *phew, phew* lil' niggas with the latest toy
Unlike you lil' nigga, I'm a grown ass man
Big shoes to fill nigga, grown ass pants
Probably hustled with your pops, go ask your parents
It's apparent you're staring at a legend who
Put a few lil' niggas in their place before
Trying to eat without saying their grace before
Blasphemous bastard get your faith restored
You're viewing your version of the Lord
God--MC lil' nigga, applaud, or
Forever burn in the fire that I spit at y'all
I rebuke you lil' nigga, the meek shall perish
I'll roof you lil' nigga, I'm a project terrorist
Cute, you lil' niggas think you in my class
Substitute lil' niggas soon feel my wrath
I mute you lil' nigga, you a lil' nigga
I shall abuse you lil' nigga, I'm a ill nigga
Now shoot you lil' niggas, go somewhere and play
Cause the day I lose to you lil niggas, no day

[Hook: Jay-Z]
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end we're all the same (All the same)
I pray to god, father forgive a nigga I'm never gonna change (Never gonna change)
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end we're all the same (All the same)
I pray to god, father forgive a nigga I'm never gonna change (Never gonna change)
