[Intro - Marvin Gaye sample]
Dreamed of you this morning
Then came the dawn, and
I thought you were here with me
If you could only see
How much I love you
That's all, that's all baby
Oh no oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before
I never felt that before
I never felt that before
But there's always
That's all, that's all

[Verse 1 - Jay-Z]
This is the shit you dream about with the homies steaming out
Back-to-back, backing them Beemers out
Seems as our plans to get a grant
Then go off to college, didn't pan or even out
We need it now, we need a town
We need a place to pitch, we need a mound
For now, I'm just a lazy boy
Big dreaming in my La-Z-Boy
In the clouds of smoke, been playing this Marvin
Mama forgive me, should be thinking about Harvard
But that's too far away, niggas are starving
Ain't nothing wrong with my aim, just gotta change the target
I got dreams of bagging snidd-ow, the size of pillows
I see pies every time my eyes clidd-ose
I see rides, sixes, I got to get those
Life's a bitch, I hope to not make her a widow

[Hook: sample + Jay-Z]
I never felt that before
American dreamin' (Jay-Z)
I never felt that before
Just American dreamin' (Jay-Z)
I never felt that before
American dreamin' (Jay-Z)
But there's always
That's all, that's all

[Verse 2 - Jay-Z]
Now see the life's right there, and it seems right there
It's not quite near, and it's not like we're
Professionals, moving the decimals
Know where to cop? Nah! Got a connect? No!
Who in the F knows how to be successful
Need a "personal Jesus," I'm in Depeche Mode
They say its celestial, its all in the stars
Like Tony LaRussa on how you play your Cards
Cause y'all ain't fucking with me! The ironies are
At all costs better avoid these bars
Now let's start, on your mark
Get set, let's go, get out the car
Going in circles it's a vicious cycle
This is a crash course, this ain't high school
Wake up Muttley, you're dreaming again
Your own reality show, the season begins

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Jay-Z]
Step one in this process: scramble up in your projects
And head to the heights where big coke is processed
You gotta convince them that you're not from the precinct
Please speak slow cause he no speaky no English
If he takes a liking after a couple of trips
And your money is straight, he's going to give you consignment
You're now in a game where only time can tell
Survive the droughts, I wish you well - hold up
Survive the droughts? I wish you well?
How sick am I? I wish you health
I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself
You could see the signs when the jackers is scheming
And the cops is coming, you could read they mind
You could see from behind, you could redefine
The game as we know it, one dream at a time
I'm American dreamin'
