Hit ya ass on the celly, cause I ain't got time
To be arguing with your ass, if you ain't really ready
Girl why you never ready for as long as you took
You better look like Halle Berry...or Beyonc√©
Shit then we getting married
I brought sand to the beach cause my beach is better
You can keep ya beach cause that beach whatever
Started out at The Darby, ended up at 1 Oak
Left the house with 100 grand, ended up near broke
Don't get mad at me, I'm buying bucket after bucket
When it's gone I'm like fuck it, I replace it with another one
Can't take this money with you
Burn this shit up like I'm Richard
Niggas asking is the oven on
