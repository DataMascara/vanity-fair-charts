All rhymers with Alzheimer's, line up please
All mamis with mind freeze please line up please
All bloggers with comments please, I come in peace
Let's see if we can kill your amnesia by the time I leave
All mamis I hugged before'll vouch for me
Tell 'em 'bout the time on your momma's couch mami
All hustlers who ever, bought a eighth from me
Take this time out, to set the record straight for me
'Member me? Silver bullet, hard top Ben-t-ley
They think I'm out of shape so I have to jog they memory
Think with indelible ink, I let the pen go
Verses permanently tattooed serve as mementos
Uhh, I'm so mental
My track record speaks for itself, I'm so instrumental
Allow me to rekindle, let's all "Reminisce" like Mary did
I think I have to send you a reminder, here it is

[Hook: K. Briscoe] + (Jay-Z)
Reminder (uhh) reminder (uhh)
I got it if you needed a reminder (uhh)
Reminder (uhh) reminder (uhh)
I think I better give you a reminder (uhh)
Reminder (uhh) reminder (uhh)
I got it if you needed a reminder (uhh)
Reminder (uhh) reminder (uhh)
Cause I can give you a friendly reminder (uhh)

[Jay-Z]
What the hell have y'all done
... to even have an opinion on what I've been doin
What the hell have y'all won?
... Only thing you can identify with is losing
10 #1 albums in a row, who better than me?
Only The Beatles, nobody ahead of me
I crush Elvis and his Blue Suede Shoes
Made the Rolling Stones seem sweet as Kool-Aid too
'96, '97, '98, '99
2000, 2001 and beyond
'02, '03, '04, '05
'06 and 7, '08, '09
Back-to-back, double plat', I did what you won't
Men lie, women lie, numbers don't
Ain't nothin changed for, me 'cept the year it is
I think I have to send you a reminder, here it is

[Jay-Z]
Do what I've done without cryin'
In the environment in which I did it in without dyin' my nigga
Then rap like I rap without lyin
Then tie 'em both together like I am my nigga
Then write sixteens in between runnin sixteen bid'nesses
All the while showin these young punks what the bid'ness is
As if, I'mma let you niggas style on me
As if, now everybodys senile on me
Throwbacks, I threw 'em back, remember those, button-ups?
Young Hov, tell them ordinary Joe's button up
I destroy your 4.0's
And Benz 500's it all points to OHH!
Now you niggas 'member me? tell me how could you forget
Back of Johnny's album cover, red and blue Gucci shit
Ain't nothin changed but the year it is
I think I have to send you a reminder, here it is
