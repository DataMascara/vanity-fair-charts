[Hook - Jay-Z]
I can't see 'em coming down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em coming down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

[Verse 1]
Good dude, I know you love me like cooked food
Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We should've been together having Four Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel first class to change the forecast
Never in bunches, just me and you
I loved your point of view cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
We're somewhere in a small town, somewhere locking a mall down
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
But deep inside a nigga so sick

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
On repeat, the CD of BIG's "Me and My Bitch"
Watching Bonnie and Clyde, pretending to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand saying, "Let me see that clip"
Shopping sprees, pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor but when we got rich
That's when our signals got crossed, and we got flipped
Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick, let me see - that's it
It was the cheese helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy
And then they got fussy and they don't remember that
And I don't remember you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then
You have given away without getting at me
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga living was whack
But you don't get a nigga back like that!
Shit I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had, just like that
I was just fucking them girls, I was gon' get right back
They say you can't turn a bad girl good
But once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever
I mourn forever, shit
I've got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever

[Hook]
