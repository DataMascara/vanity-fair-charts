(Can I touch that?) what's that? Leave it for dead
Keep ya arm over ya face my nigga (keep ya head)
(keep a mind to survive if ya sleep ya dead)
Stay fly 'til ya die nigga deep with prayer
(with each word ya say I guess the beef is dead)
Ladies & gentlemen (like impeach the Prez)
(Val Kilmer style nigga draw heat with feds)
(broad day like De Niro shoot all day)
I'm the man fuckin' the tracks and you just foreplay
Get a hit I, I come through, blow up, you spit out
What keep it cocked faithfully like salop
With one in the drop don't get hit up
(I be the 4-5th flamer hoes bitch shamer)
(clap cats a snitch she'll give ya whole click name up)
Look I done came up (and) thought a whole game up
Meet me in the square with one in the chamber
(The Face Off nigga)
