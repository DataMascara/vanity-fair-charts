Uh uh
So So Def
Yeah, yeah

Chorus: Jermaine Dupri and Jay-Z

[Jermaine Dupri]
In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang
[Jay-Z]
Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang
[Jermaine Dupri]
Jigga, I don't like it if it don't glean clean
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang
[Jay-Z]
Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bing
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

[Jermaine Dupri]
Come on, y'all wanna floss wit us
Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Ya slackin on your pimpin, turn it up
See the money ain't a thang

[Jay-Z]
I flex the Rol', sign a check for yo' ho
Jigga's style is love, X and O
Save all your accolades, just the dough
My game is wide, all lames aside
Tryin to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain ya eye
Twin platinum gun son, aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it
Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young
See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up
Multi til I close up, it's all basic
I been spending hundreds since they had small faces
Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas
Me and J.D. got it locked crazy
Where you at haters?

Chorus

[Jermaine Dupri]
My cake thick, I live the life
Eatin' crab, watching bitches shake shit all night
I make the big moves, do the big things
Take small groups, turn them into big names
The big dog with the big chain, frostbit bracelet to match
Cats say I'm the shit man
The type of nigga that you need in yo' crew
Type of dude that will do shit you won't do, can't do
Get more burn than a candle
Too hot to hold, too much to handle
In the black C-low, he know if she look
She go bye-bye with da-da and I ain't gotta say no mo'
I'm "The Truth" like A.I., got the proof and stay fly
In the safest shit you could never buy
Know why? Cause I write the songs that the whole world sing
I don't know about y'all but every night I swing

Chorus

[Jay-Z]
Ya'll shit ain't for real til y'all ship a mil'
And ya hit a R&B chick and she fit the bill
Said she loved my necklace, started relaxing
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
Went from wholesome to Jigga, you awe-some
Baby, I don't play all my jewelry is light grey
Platinum, spend your whole life in the day
What's down is a bet, roll the dice

[Jermaine Dupri]
Yeah, yeah, so let's play
So what you went gold and rock a Roley with the ice bezel
It's gon' take a lot mo' to see my level
Where I'm at, your check, you better double that
And personally your raps is where the trouble at
I'm a Benz bubble cat, leather with the wood grain
In the platinum frame screamin it's not a game
Gleamin, from ear to ear, wrist to wrist, ring and chain
Even me and Jay-Z got it locked, crazy

Chorus

[Jermaine Dupri]
So So Def, Roc-A-Fella, collabo'
You know, all we do is..

Rock, rock on (*repeat to fade*)
