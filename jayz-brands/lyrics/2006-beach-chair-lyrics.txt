[Verse 1]
Life is but a dream to me, I don't wanna wake up
Thirty odd years without having my cake up
So I'm about my paper 24/7, 365, 366 in a leap year
I don't know why we here
Since we gotta be here life is but a beach ch-ch-ch-chair
Went from having shabby clothes, crossing over Abbey Road
Hear my angels singing to me (are you happy, Hov?)
I just hope I'm hearing right; karma's got me fearing life
Colleek are you praying for me?
See I got demons in my past, so I got daughters on the way
If the prophecy's correct, then the child should have to pay
For the sins of a father, so I barter my tomorrows against my yesterdays
In hopes that she'll be okay
And when I'm no longer here to shade her face from the glare
I'll give her my share of Carol's Daughter and a new beach chair

[Hook: Chris Martin]
I hear my angels sing
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave

[Verse 2]
Life is but a dream to me
Gun shots sing to these other guys
But lullabies don't mean a thing to me
I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of not trying
Everyday hit every wave like I'm Hawaiian
I don't surf the net, no, I never been on MySpace
Too busy letting my voice vibrate
Carving out my space in this world of fly girls
Cut-throats and diamond-cut ropes I twirls
Benzes round corners where the sun don't shine
I let the wheels give a glimpse of hope of one's grind
Some said: "Hov, how you get so fly?"
I said: "from not being afraid to fall out the sky"
My physical's a shell so when I say farewell
My soul will find an even higher plane to dwell
So fly you shall
So have no fear, just know that
Life is but a beach chair

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Life is but a dream
Can't mimic my life
I'm the thinnest cut slice
Intercut, the winner's cup
With winters rough enough to interrupt life
That's why I'm both saint and sinner, nice
This is Jay everyday, no compromise
No compass comes with this life just eyes
So to map it out you must look inside
Sure books can guide you but your heart defines you, chica
Your corazón is what brought us home
In great shape like Heidi Klum, Maricón, I am on
Permanent vacay, life is but a beach chair
This song is like a Hallmark card until you reach here
So 'til she's here, and she's declared
The heir, I will prepare
A blueprint for you to print
A map for you to get back
A guide for your eyes, and so you won't lose scent
I'll make a stink for you to think
I ink these verses full of prose
So you won't get conned out of two cent
My last will and testament I leave my heir
My share of Roc-A-Fella Records and a shiny new beach chair
