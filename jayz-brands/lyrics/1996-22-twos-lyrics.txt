Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Y'all motherfuckers must've heard that Tribe Called Quest shit
Let's do it again!
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Well I'm gone... check this out

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Too much West coast dick licking, and too many niggas on a mission
Doing your best Jay-Z rendition
Too many rough motherfuckers, I got my suspicions
That you're just fish in a pool of sharks nigga, listen
Too many bitches wanna be ladies, so if you a ho
I'm a call you a ho, too many bitches are shady
Too many ladies give these niggas too many chances
Too many brothers wannabe lovers don't know what romance is
Too many bitches stuck up from too many sexual advances
No question; Jay-Z got too many answers
I been around this block too many times
Rocked too many rhymes, cocked too many nines, too
To all my brothers it ain't too late to come together
Cause too much black and too much love, equal forever
I don't follow any guidelines cause too many niggas ride mine
So I change styles every two rhymes

Hah, what the fuck
That's 22 two's for y'all motherfuckers out there, nahmean?
Shall I continue? Check it out, what?

Can I kick it? (Yes you can!) *repeat 3X*
Well I'm gone... yo, yo, yo

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Copped to reach my quota, push rock, roll up smooth like on ya
Whole groove like hold-up, swoll up
Too many faggot niggas clocking my spending
Exercising your gay-like minds like Richard Simmons
If you could catch Jay right, on the late night
Without the eight, right, maybe you could test my weight, right
I dip, spit quicker than you ever seen
Adminster pain, next the minister's screaming your name
At your wake as I peek in, look in your casket
Feeling sarcastic, "Look at him, still sleeping"
You never ready, forever petty minds stay petty
Mine's thinking longevity until I'm seventy
Living heavenly, fuck, felony after felony, what?
Nigga you broke, what the fuck you going to tell me?
