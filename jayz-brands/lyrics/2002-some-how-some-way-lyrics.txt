(Please believe that) Some how some way
We gotta make it up out the hood some day
Some how some way
We gotta make it up out this life
Some how some way
We gotta make it up out this life
Some way we gotta make it up out this life

[Jay-Z]
Weather we dribble out this motherfucker
Rap metaphors and riddle out this motherfucker
Work second floors, hospital out this motherfucker
Some how we gotta get up out this motherfucker
Some day the cops will kill a motherfucker
I don't always want to be this drug dealing
Motherfucker damn
Wish I could take us all on this magic carpet ride
Through the sky I
Used to play the hall and fifth floor, me and my boys we
All poor getting high I
Seen the worst of the worst I deserve every blessing
I received I'm from the dirt
I planted my seed on unfertile land Myrtle Park
Marcy, Flushing and Nostrand and
Still I grew some how I knew the sun will shine through
And touch my soul take hold of my hand
Look man a tree grows in Brooklyn

[Hook]
Some how some way
I gotta make it up out the hood someday
Some how some way
I gotta make it up out this life
Some way I gotta make it up out this hood someday

Talking:( To old Nell, Sigel street I ain't forget you)

Twenty niggas on the block trying to chase that buck
Nosey neighbors and haters keep their face on stuck
Cops roll up on the pavement break the dice games up
Behind smoke kids can't chase the ice cream truck
Girls fighting over Rollie young boys hype things up
Niggas fighting over Cold young boys light things up
All the petty ass wars fuck the night scene up
Remember Lil' Eddie man how he light mean up
Then they wonder why we light green up
Back to back steamers trying to relax but I can't
I lean up ain't the L or the refer that steam up
It's my head stress to the point I get a fever
Thinking bout the block and all the mothers and kids
That can't leave and how the Chinks gotta feed'em
For the rest of their life fucking wings fried
Vegetable rice(gotta be kidding)
No breakfast Cap'n Crunch at night
Our kids eating lunch at night
In their beds all bunched in tight
No less than three or four(you know how it go)
Two by the foot two by the headboard
Man I'm getting scared for them (Yeah I know)
Thats how I feel for them
And we gotta grip the shorties on the block
All they do is smoke weed and drink forties
Cop their quarties
Enough to get the latest ROC, newest Glock, and old Jordies

[Hook]
Some how some way
We gonna make it up out the hood someday
Some how some way
We gonna make it up out this life
Some how some way
We gonna make it up out the hood one day
Some way we gonna make it up out this life

[Scarface]
Right here another lil' story bout this click I claimed
Another chapter based on how I get that game
Hanging round my neighborhood and bang my street
Sit and watch the passer-bys play my sweep
South-side sunny side
Blocks I run South Vegas, South Paul
Nigga all got guns
Over here we got this poor (?) get that there
We know tomorrow ain't promise so we get that there
Fuck sitting in the living room guarding the steps
Working inside a slump house starving to death
Serving these nigga flippers, quarter-ounces and
Zippers agents snapping your picture neighbors
Plotting to get ya
Situations is critic I was out here to get it
Living it like a savage cause nigga I gotta have it
And holding back all the mothers for a minute
Pumping hard dog
Erase enough to walk it down and fuck it all dog
God be willin' and the creek don't rise
I'm be a nigga and these streets gonna rise
(Some how some way)
(Some how some way)
I'm be a nigga and these streets gonna rise

[Hook]
Some how some way
We gotta make it up out the hood some day
Some how some way
We gotta make it up out this life
Some how some way
We gotta make it up out the hood some day
Some way we gotta make it up out this life
