[Intro - Jay-Z]
Come experience life as we know it
As some of you should know it
Place: Marcy, Brooklyn
Actions: Well, y'all know the actions

[Verse 1 - Jay-Z]
I got this shorty on my block always clocking my rocks
He likes the style and profile I think he want to mock
He likes the way I walk, he see my money talking
To honeys hawking I'm the hottest nigga in New York and
I see his hunger pains, I know his blood boils
He want to run with me, I know this kid will be loyal
I watched him make a few ends, to cop his little sneakers and gear
Then it's just enough for re-up again
I see myself in his eyes, I moved from Levi's
To Guess to Versace, now it's diamonds like Liberace
That's just the natural cycle, nobody want to be like Michael
Where I'm from, just them niggas who bounced from a gun
We out here trying to make hard white into cold green
I can help shorty blow out like Afro-Sheen
Plus I can relive my days of youth which is gone
That little nigga's peeps, it's time to put him on

[Hook]
It's time to come up (Jay-Z)
And hold my own weight, defend my crown (Memphis Bleek)
Got to lock it down and when they rush (Jay-Z)
Stand my ground (Memphis Bleek)
It's time to come up (Jay-Z)
Stick up my chest, and make some loot (Memphis Bleek)
Got to lock it down and when they rush (Jay-Z)
Stand on my own two (Memphis Bleek)

[Verse 2 - Memphis Bleek]
I'm out here slinging, bringing the drama, trying to come up
In the game and add a couple of dollar signs to my name
I'm out here serving, disturbing the peace, life could be better
Like my man reclined in plush leather seats
He's selling weight, I'm selling eight balls
Sixteen, trying to graduate to pushing quarters y'all
I ain't going to sweat him I'm a let him come to me
If he give me the nod then these niggas going to see
I'm tired of being out here round the clock
And breaking day, and chasing crack heads up the block for my pay
I'm staying fresh, so chickens check
I'm trying to step up to the next level, pushing Vettes through the 'jects
Diamonds reflect from the sun, directly in your equilibrium
And stunned I'm waiting for my day to come
I got the urge to splurge, I don't want a lifetime sentence
Just give me the word

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey fella I been watching you clocking (Jay-Z)
Who me? Holding down this block it ain't nothing (Memphis Bleek)
You the man nigga, now stop fronting
Hahah I like your style (Jay-Z)
Nah, I like your style (Memphis Bleek)
Let's drive around awhile (Jay-Z)
Cool nigga (Memphis Bleek)
Here's a thou' (Jay-Z)
A G? I ride with you for free
I want the long-term riches and bitches (Memphis Bleek)
Have it all, now listen to me
You let them other niggas get the name, skip the fame
Ten thou' or a hundred G keep your shit the same (Jay-Z)
On the low? (Memphis Bleek)
Yeah, the only way to blow
You let your shit bubble quietly (Jay-Z)
And then you blow (Memphis Bleek)
Hey keep your cool
The only way to peep a fool is let him show his hand
Then you play your cards (Jay-Z)
Then he through dealing I understand (Memphis Bleek)
Don't blow your dough on hotties (Jay-Z)
The only thing I got in this world is my word and my nuts
And won't break them for nobody (Memphis Bleek)
Hah, I like your resume, pick a day, you can start (Jay-Z)
From now until death do us part nigga (Memphis Bleek)

[Hook 2X]
