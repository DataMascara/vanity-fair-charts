Check one check two
Shit you know what to do
Primo, Cold Crush when I give it to you
Friend or foe yo, state your biz
You tend to dough, ah, there it is
Me, I run the show, oh, and these kids
Don't like nobody coming around here fucking with they dough for shit
You enterprising though, and I like'ya
But fuck with the big dogs yo, I gotta bite you
Look, it's out of my hands
And you getting money around here, it's not in the plans
So hop your ass out of that van, head back to Kansas
I'm sending niggas back up in campuses
Chance is slimmer than that chick in Calvin Klein pants is
Let me guess, they said it was money around here
And the rest is me stopping you from getting it, correct?
Sorry to hear that, my guess is you got work at the hotel
I'll take care of that, you'll soon see
Now please give me the room key
You're twitching, don't do that, you making me nervous
My crew, well, they do pack, them dudes is murderers
So please would you, put your hand back in sight
They don't like to see me nervous you can understand that, right?
You draw, better be Picasso, you know the best
Cause if this is not so, ah, God bless
You leave me no choice, I'll leave you no voice
Believe you me son:
I hate to do it just as bad as you hate to see it done
Now calm your boys
Cause I'm finding it a little hard to concentrate with all the noise
Get the point, I'll let you go
Before you leave, I guess I ought to let you know, I need those keys
And promise you never, no matter the weather
Everevereverevereverever come around here no more
