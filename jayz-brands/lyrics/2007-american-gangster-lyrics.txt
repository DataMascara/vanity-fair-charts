[Verse 1]
I'm from the 80's
Home of the heroin
Era of the hustlers
The world is my custy
New Rich Porter
The way I flip quarters
Front on all these other rap artists, but me
Momma was a mink wearer
Papa ran numbers
So it's plain to see where my whole plan come from
American dream
I'm living the life still
The way I shine is like a zillion dollar light bill
Still I'm grinding, army jacket lining
Forty below Timbs on, getting my M's on
My best friends gone, I seen bad days
Still find songs that I hear him on
Getting my Mary J. Blige Reminisce on
I hear his voice in my mind like, nigga live on
So I get on that fly shit I been on
Spin on corners in Enzo with rims on
But for info, puffing on Endo-Nesia
Give me amnesia
I ease up, that right, I'm high nigga
I want the sky
The world when I'm done
I'm give it to my sons
Let em live it up, split it up, switch it up
Sixes kit it up
Man I did it up, done
The rest of my belongings belong in the hall of fame
A list of hits next to all my names
I came

[Verse 2]
If the sky should fall
And it all goes tomorrow and they foreclose on the house and auction off all my cars
Don't cry for me Argentina
I mobbed the Beamer
Took trips abroad, got mobbed in Sardina
In Ibiza I had pizza in the club
Ladies know I'm that guy
They wanna piece of my love
Now they wanna do your boy like Mike in his prime
Billie Jean the goddamn boy ain't mine
And the Roc break up, had the people losing hope
Can't lie they had Muhammad Hovi on the ropes
Now I'm back in the go mode, back in the go-go's
Throwing the diamond up, repping the logo
Rose gold rose flow
I'm okay though
What Don't kill me makes stronger than before so
Here we go and I'm not domino
When it all falls down
I'm like Kanye's jaw
I might break but I don't fold til I hold the sky in my hand
Yeah that's my goal
And then I bid you Freddy Adu
Prodigal Child, y'all not ready for the future
Then I disappear in the Bermuda Triangle
My name will be viewed such
Here's to the man that refused to give up
I want the sky nigga, church
