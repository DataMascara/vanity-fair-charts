[Verse 1]
What we talking bout? Real shit or we talking 'bout rhymes?
You talking 'bout millions or you talking 'bout mine?
What we talking 'bout, cause I ain't got time
For what people be talking 'bout all the time
What we talking 'bout fiction or we talking 'bout fact?
You talking 'bout fiction? Hold up, pardon my back
I'm talking 'bout life and all I hear is:
"Oh yeah he keeps talking 'bout crack"
I ain't talking 'bout profit, I'm talking 'bout pain
I'm talking 'bout despair, I'm talking 'bout shame
I ain't talking 'bout gossip, I ain't talking 'bout Game
I ain't talkin bout Jimmy, I ain't talking 'bout Dame
I'm talking 'bout real shit, them people playin'
What is you talking 'bout? I don't know what y'all sayin'
People keep talking 'bout "Hov take it back"
I'm doin' better than before, why would I do that?
Ain't nothing cool about carrying a strap
Bout worrying your moms and burying your best cat
Talking 'bout revenge while carrying his casket
All teary-eyed, bout to take it to a mattress
I'm talking 'bout music, I ain't talking 'bout rap
You talking 'bout who's hot - I ain't talking 'bout that
The conversation is changed, let's yap about that
I don't run rap no more, I run the map

[Hook]
They talk, we live, we see what they say
They talk, We did, who cares what they say

[Verse 2]
Still they can't' focus on them, they be talking 'bout me
Talking 'bout what I wear, talking 'bout where I be
Check out my hair: these ain't curls these is peas
"Peasey head" still get paid, I'm combin' through G's
Please, we ain't focused on naps
Cause I don't run rap no more, I run the map
A small part of the reason the President is black
I told him I got him when he hit me on the jack
Talking 'bout progress, I ain't lookin' back
You know I run track - try not to get lapped
People keep talking 'bout Hov left em flat
Try to re-write history, let's talk about facts
Dame made millions, even Jaz made some scraps
He could've made more but he ain't sign his contract
As far as street guys, we was dealing crack
That's just how the game goes, I don't owe nobody jack
Grown men want me to sit em on my lap
But I don't have a beard and Santa Claus ain't black
I repeat, you can't sit on my lap
I don't have a beard now get off my sack
Scream at me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Blueprint 3
And now that that's that, let's talk about the future
We have just seen the dream as predicted by Martin Luther
Now you could choose to sit in front of your computer
Posing with guns, shooting YouTube up
Or you could come with me to the White House - get your suit up
You stuck on being hardcore, I chuck the deuce up
Peace out Medusa
Welcome to the Blue-ah-Print-ah
Tre-piece, Jay-Z your tutor
Tooter of my own horn beep beep moo-ya
Ras clot when rude boy come through with the roof up
So I could see the sky
Cause everybody talking, Hov I think we know why
