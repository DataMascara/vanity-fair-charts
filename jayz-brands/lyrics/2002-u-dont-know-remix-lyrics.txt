[Jay-Z]
I'm not trying to be no big thing, no no
You gotta let this one breathe Just
Just let it breathe for a second
I'm not trying to give you no advice
Yup Hovi's home
The newest addition to The Roc, M.O.P
I don't claim to be
The Blueprint 2 is on it's way
No philosopher
I know y'all hear my footsteps out there, I'm coming
But I sure know, this is life, baby, baby
Let's go get 'em Just

[Verse 1: Lil' Fame]
Time to dump fiyah dump fiyah
Dump fiyah, dump fiyah, dump fiyah
You don't know, what you're doing, doing, doing, doing
It's the Mo' P
And the zip code is 1 2 3
THREE, and motherfucker we coming
100 miles and gunning
I'm still running with cats that rob
From the era of XL 80's and hatchback Saabs
Operation for this industry lockdown
We still tote hammers that go blak-ow
Run up if you wanna
Believe me dawg
These hammers with they owners
Fuck your G up
Have ya with blue Pampers in a coma
And your family now moan
Look seventy pounds gone
A little fuck, shriveled up with a hospital gown on
We holding it down homes
Keep pushing we fell bastards
To get over, we prowl with slippery shell tactics
Jiminy frail bastards, your tracks need tune-ups
Lil' niglette
What the fuck you recordin for Nick Jr
The game ain't changed
It just got harder
Plus we sponsored by Laze, Dame Dash and Mr. S dot Carter
Brownsville, we stomp through this bitch all day
Rock with my cock out, face the crowd and piss off stage

[Billy Danze]
I'm from the G side of thangs
Where we ride and bang
With a heat dat'll flame
That's how we got the name
Warriors
Embedded in ya brains
And someone should be telling em the veterans have came
And we're better in the game
You better make it rain
My man, it's better than cocaine
Now everything will change and this Family will rule the world
And you haters can eat a dick up till you hiccup and earl!
A decade on the grind, nigga I paid mine
So it's my time to shine and for you to ride the pine
I won't sit back and rap like these dumb-ass kids
I been around, I put it down
I ain't these young-ass kids
The O.G.'s repped and survived around this motherfucker
We kept it live around this motherfucker
When it's crunch time, we do it our wizzay
For shizzle my nigga, learn to grip pistols in B.K

[Jay-Z]
Turn my music high, high, high, high-er
Mo' fire, more Roc-a-wear attire
Mo' money, mo' murder now that M.O.P.'s hired
Mo' further for the Roc Empire
Y'all won't serve us
Y'all nervous
Know them guns on full service, ready to fire
One body, two body, three body, four
Young sitting on paper, I'm above the law
Young shitting on haters, I ain't fucking with y'all
For my Brownsville neighbors, how About Some Hardcore
And it just get worser
Every time I sign my signature in cursive
Just add another million to these verses
One million, two million, three million, four
And the money's really worthless
I'm pissing you off on purpose
My nephew's situated and my mom is straight
So I'm ready for whatever drama should come my way
And you niggas rapping to me, so your drama is fake
You dudes is noodles, I got more ziti to bake
You dudes is cake
I keep two biscuits on the waist
Razor blades under the tongue
I will eat your face
Appetite for destruction
I am starving today
Got a money hungry lawyer that'll eat the case
And that's just food for thought, don't let it go to waste
Nigga bite the bullet until you stuffing your face, ha
I done forgot more than you ever learned
What you don't know will make your home a permanent urn, nigga

[Outro]
Do you believe it
You don't know, what you're doing - doing - doing - doing
Do you believe it
You don't know, what you're doing - doing - doing - doing
Do you believe it
