[Intro: Nigo]
億万長者少年倶楽部

[Pre-Hook: Third Ward Trill]
My mothafucka is a billionaire mothafucka, you heard that shit
I said my mothafucka is a billionaire mothafucka

[Hook]
Let's work
D boy drug dealer look
Billionaire
D boy drug dealer look
Billionaire nigga!
From the coca leafs to the farmers
To the polo fleece to the bombers
R.I.P. to Gianni
Now we on our way
D boy drug dealer look
Billionaire

[Verse 1: Nas]
Bally shoes, Gucci sneakers
Pharrell's a pharaoh, peep the features
Unlaced Adidas
Top of the world like pyramids in Giza
Fila sweats, 88 I rocked a mock neck
Carried a nine in my projects
Bucket hat EPMD cassettes
Now I'm smoking loud in Ibiza
Mix the D'USSE with the reefer
My whole life is leisure
Gangsta lean like the Pisa
Eiffel Tower, Hermes towel
The Feds is perched like an owl
Real niggas all feel the hook

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
What you know about going out, head west
Maybach, 3 TV's all up in the headrest
Mace niggas at Madison Square Garden
20 million sold and we still catching charges
Rope chains, Rakim and Eric B
Bought my sidekicks Suzuki Jeeps and Cherokees
Hoop earrings, coupes with the rear cameras
Put that bitch in a cherry M3
I'm not your average dope dealer
Silver Toyotas four runners and four wheelers
Me and Teflon Q45 infinite
Windows tinted, white girl all in it
Britney, bitch
MCM seats buck 50 stitch
Versace plates got the Basquiat
Collab from Versace's place
Cuban link 5 kilo
Your life is illegal when your chain can get the rico
Real niggas all feel the hook

[Hook]

[Outro]
자기 신발 끝내주는데
자기 돈 좀 많나봐
자기 스타일 진짜 멋있다
백만장자 소년들의 모임
