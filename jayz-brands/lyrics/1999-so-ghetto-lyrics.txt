[Verse 1]
Career crook, nobody rep Brooklyn like me
Jigga-Man, Volume 3, I'm back lookin' like me
Stop the presses, baby girls, drop your dresses
B-K lick a shot for Big Pop' in heaven
Ever since I came through, niggas got the impression
Everything I drop, out of the question, stop the guessin'
It's hot, flows proving I pack cause my dough's moving
My whole crew up in this muh'fucker
We spray corners, stand there like you got a cape on ya, fine
You'll be wearing a black suit a long time
I put your crew in hard bottoms
The priest is like, "God's got him
He never did nuttin to nobody but them boys shot him"
Brandish iron, outlandish buyin'
Bentley Coupes, not bragging just simply the truth
We all from the ghetto, only difference, we go back
Back up in D&D on this Preemo track, listen

[Hook]
I'm so gangsta prissy chicks don't wanna fuck with me
"Iceberg Slim, baby ride rims"
I'm so gutter, ghetto girls fall in love with me
"You know him well..." "...by the name of Jigga"
I'm so gangsta prissy chicks don't wanna fuck with me
"You can love me or hate me..." "Jay-Z"
I'm so gutter, ghetto girls fall in love with me
"Roc-a-Fella lock the whole block down"

[Verse 2]
Wednesday's I'm up in Shine, Cheetah's Monday night
I'm fucking with the model chicks Friday night at Life
So I'm cruising in the car with this bougie broad
She said, "Jigga-Man you rich, take the doo-rag off"
Hit a U-turn, "Ma I'm dropping you back off"
Front of the club, "Jigga why you do that for?"
Thug nigga til the end, tell a friend bitch
Won't change for no paper plus I been rich
'88 been hustlin', linen been crushin' 'em
Women been fuckin' 'em, huh?
You see I live for the love of the street
Rap to the ruggedest beats
Hall closet cluttered with heat
I spit that murder-murder-murder
That Brook-Brook-a-Brooklyn shit
Furthermore ma
We tote guns to the Grammys, pop bottles on the White House lawn
Guess I'm just the same old Shawn

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm from the M-to-the-A-baby-R-C-Y
So it's hard for me to let the larceny die
Niggas see me in the streets with no bodyguards
Just two big guns that'll body your squad
Could niggas be scheamin on me? Probably are
Think Jigga's a joke nigga? Hardy har
I spit Brook-Brook-Brooklyn every time I bust
Radio's gotta play me though I cuss too much
Magazines say I'm shallow, I never learned to swim
Still they put me on they cover cause I earn for them
Soon as I sell too much, watch them turn on him
Cause that seem to be the shit that'll earn for them
I spit that murder-murder-murderous everytime a verbalist
Iller than Verbal Kint is or O-Dog in "Menace"
I'm ill, start to finish, I rip apart contenders
I'm hot.. hehehehe

[Hook]

[Outro]
I'm so gangsta prissy chicks don't wanna fuck with me, uhh
I'm so gutter, ghetto girls

Uhh, yeah, funk, yeah, with me, yeah, beyotch, yeah
Jigga, yeah, Primo, yeah, gangsta, yeah, niggas, yeah
Brooklyn, yeah
