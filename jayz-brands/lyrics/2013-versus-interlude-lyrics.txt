Hey sucka nigga, wherever you are
I thought about you, fool, while I was driving my car
I wonder if you fools realize how far, you are
You're no where in my rear mirror

Your last shit ain't better than my first shit
Your best shit ain't better than my worst shit
The truth in my verses versus
Your metaphors about what your net worth is

Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha!
