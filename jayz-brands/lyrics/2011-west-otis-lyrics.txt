[Intro: Otis Redding]
It makes it easier, easier to bear
You won't be regret it, no, no, no
Some girls, they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
(Sounds so soulful, don’t you agree?)

[Jay-Z]
I invented swag, poppin bottles, putting supermodels in the cab
Proof, I guess I got my swagger back, truth
New watch alert: Hublots
Or the big face Rollie, I got two of those
Arm out the window through the city, I maneuver slow
Cock back, snap back, see my cut through the holes

[Kanye West]
Damn Yeezy and Hov, where the hell ya been?
Niggas talking real reckless; stuntmen
I adopted these niggas, Phillip Drummond them
Now I’m about to make them tuck their whole summer in
They say I’m crazy, but I’m about to go dumb again
They ain't seen me cause I pulled up in my other Benz
Last week I was in my other other Benz
Throw your diamonds up cause we in this bitch another 'gain

[Jay-Z]
Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth
I’m 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself
Live from the Mercer
Run up on Yeezy the wrong way, I might murk ya
Flee in the G450 I might surface
Political refugee, asylum can be purchased
Everything's for sale
I got 5 passports, I’m never going to jail

[Kanye West]
I made Jesus Walks, so I'm never going to hell
Couture level flow is never going on sale
Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses
Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive
I get it custom, you a customer
You ain't accustomed to going through customs
You ain't been nowhere, hah?
And all the ladies in the house got them showing off
I’m done I'll hit you up maña...nah!

[Jay-Z]
Welcome to Havana
Smoking Cubana’s with Castro in cabanas
Viva Mexico, Cubano
Dominicano, all the plugs that I know
Driving Benzes with no benefits
Not bad, huh, for some immigrants?
Build your fences, we digging tunnels
Can’t you see we gettin money up under you?

[Kanye]
Can’t you see the private jets flying over you?
Maybach bumper sticker reads: "What would Hova do?"
Jay is chilling, Ye is chilling
What more can I say? We killing 'em
Hold up before we end this campaign
As you can see we done bodied the damn lames
Lord please let them accept the things they can't change
And pray that all of their pain be champagne
