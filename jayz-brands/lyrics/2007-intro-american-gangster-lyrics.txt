[Intro:]
"Man I worked for one of the biggest companies in New York City
He didn't own his own company. White man owned it, so they owned him. Nobody owns me though."
(Your gangster is not defined)
Your gangster is not defined by how low your jeans fall by your waist,but more how your jeans stand over expensive taste
(Never forgetting where we came from)
(Your gangster)
Your gangster is not defined by how many rocks are in your watch, but rather how many rocks you move while on your watch
(Gangsters, hustlers, republicans, democrats, pimps and hoes.)
Conservatives, labor, the seller, the buyer, the product, the producer
(See you are what you are in this world.)
The gangster is absorbed and adored by those that don't understand the laws that govern gangsterment
(Gangsterment)
Gangsterment allows you to make up your own laws and create brand new words
Gangster mentality
(Gangster mentality, an American way created by the white, mastered by the black
And absorbed by the fiends, taxed by the governmentality,
Charted by forbes. If you believe in Jay-Z then you too can be a gangster.)
Then you too can be a gangster, by any means necessary
By owning that dream
I mean it's a long walk to freedom but, while deep, deep, deep inside the bush
(The war on terror screams, damn it feels good)
Damn it feels good to be a gangster
(To be a gangster swagger is not a must, it's a liability, a cliche, a bad suit, cut the bullshit
You know if it wasn't for this, there would be no that.)
Which we call, the American Gangster
