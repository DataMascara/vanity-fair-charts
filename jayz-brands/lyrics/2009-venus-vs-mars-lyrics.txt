[Verse 1]
Hov's a Blackberry Bold, shorty is a Sidekick
She used to have a man, I used to have a side chick
Shorty got wind, I had to blow the chick off
She got rid of him, they both took the shit hard
Shorty played the piano, me I played with white keys
Shorty from the South, oh I think she like me
Shorty like Pac, me, Big Poppa
She screaming hit 'em up, I'm screaming who shot ya?
I'm on that red wine, shorty like white
Same shit, different toilet, we both getting nice
Me I'm from the Apple, which means I'm a Mac
She's a PC, she lives in my lap

[Hook]
Shorty get it in (Daddy go hard)
Shorty get it in, Venus versus Mars

[Verse 2]
Whether black or white, we both like Mike
We both like Jordans, we both Phil's Knight
I finish my breakfast, shorty's out to lunch
Yeah we both eating, it's better than brunch
Shorty like Pepsi, me I'm the coke man
Body like a Coke bottle, I crush it like a Coke can
Started at the window, end up at the wall
The Yin to my Yang, I skeet skeet off
In a salt and pepper 'Bach, shorty like to front
The Bonnie to my Clyde, both riding shotgun
Both covered in gold like C3P0
James and Florida Evans, let the good times roll

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Thought shorty was the truth, found out she was a cheater
We were supposed to Takeover, I caught her bumping Ether
I thought shorty liked Mike, found out she liked Prince
Thought she was Adrian, it's been rocky ever since
My dollars was down, she left me for some Euros
Took my whole flavour, I call her Coke Zero
We were co-MVP's like Kobe and Shaq
Left me for the Heat, we were winning back to back
Said I party too much, shorty got fed up
Shorty got Britney, shaved her whole head up
We used to make out, kissing each other's face off
Fell for the Ponzi scheme, damn shorty just made off

[Hook]
