[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
You'd take the clothes off my back and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth and I'd watch you eat it
I still donâ€™t know why, why our love is so much, ohh
(Thanks for warning me, thanks for warning me)
You curse my name, in spite to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean, give it up for fame
But I still don't know why, why I love it so much
(Thanks for warning me, thanks for warning me)

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
And baby, it's amazing I'm in this maze with you, I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud, the next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair, sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over, Holy Grail

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Blue told me remind you niggas
Fuck that shit y'all talking 'bout, I'm the nigga
Caught up in all these lights and cameras
But look what that shit did to Hammer
Goddammit it I like it
Bright lights is enticing but look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night, thirty mill for one fight
But soon as all the money blows, all the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheating on me, what I do, I took her back
Fool me twice that's my bad, I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder, momma please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame, Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid and contagious
And we all just entertainers

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Now I got tattoos on my body, psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper, photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk, see 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off enough is enough, I'm calling this off
Who the fuck I'm kidding though, I'm getting high, sitting low
Sliding by in that big body, curtains all in my window
This fame hurt but this chain worse, I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with, nigga deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snapping, my eyes hurt, niggas dying back where
I was birthed, fuck your iris and the IRS, get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours, why you mad?
Take the good with the bad, or throw the baby out with that bath water

[Bridge: Jay Z]
You still alive, still that nigga
Nigga you survived, you still getting bigger
Nigga, living the life, vanilla wafers in a villa
Illest nigga alive, Michael Jackson's Thriller

[Hook]

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
And you take the blade right out my heart, just so you can watch me bleed
And I still don't know why, why I love you so much, yeah
And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve forever in ink with guess whose name
But I still don't know why, why our love is so much

[Hook]
