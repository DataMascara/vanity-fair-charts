[Verse 1]
I sold it all from crack to opium, in third person
I don't wanna see them, so I'm rehearsing
With my peoples how to G them
From a remote location in the BM
Scoping the whole situation like, "Damn!"
Metamorphic, as the dope turns to cream
But one of these buyers got eyes like a Korean, it's difficult to read them
The windows to his soul are half closed, I put the key in
Pulled off slow, hoping my people fleeing
Chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in
Coppers was watching us through nighttime binoculars
This time they got us on tape, exchanging dope for dollars
Make me wanna, holler back at the crib in the sauna
Praying my people bailed out like Time/Warner
Awaiting a call, from his kin not the coroner
Phone in my hand, nervous confined to a corner
Beads of sweat, second thoughts on my mind
How can I ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets
This time, stress, giving this shit up, fuck

[Hook]
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive got to learn to live with regrets
On the rise to the top many drop, don't forget
In order to survive got to learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive got to learn to live with regrets
And through our travels we get separated, never forget
In order to survive got to learn to live with regrets

[Verse 2]
As sure as this, Earth is turning, souls burning
In search of higher learning, turning in every direction seeking direction
My moms crying because her insides are dying
Her son trying her patience, keep her heart racing
A million beats a minute, I know I push you to your limit
But it's this game love, I'm caught up all in it
They make it so you can't prevent it
Never give it, you gotta take it
Can't fake it, I keep it authentic
My hand got this pistol shaking, cause I sense danger
Like Camp Crystal Lake and
Don't wanna shoot him, but I got him trapped
Within this infrared dot, about to hot him and hit rock bottom
No answers to these trick questions, no time shit stressing
My life found, I got to live for the right now
Time waits for no man, can't turn back the hands
Once it's too late, gotta learn to live with regrets

[Hook]
You used to hold me, told me that I was the best
Anything in this world I want I could possess
All that made me want is all that I could get
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets (when I was young)

[Verse 3]
I found myself reminiscing, remember this one?
When he was here he was crazy nice with his son
I miss him, long as I'm living he's living through memories
He's there to kill all my suicidal tendencies
In heaven looking over me, or in hell, keeping it cozy
I'm coming, life on these streets ain't what it's supposed to be
Remember Newton, mutual friend, well me and him feuding
On your life I tried to talk to him
But you know niggas, think they guns can stop four niggas
Fronting like they're big willie but really owe niggas
Ho niggas, this year I'll show niggas, Think I'm slipping?
I'm about to send you a roommate, no bullshitting
But my hustle's going too well to hit him
You was right niggas want you to be miserable with them
Anyway, I ain't trying to hear it, I think I'm touched
This whole verse I been talking to your spirit, a little too much

[Hook]
