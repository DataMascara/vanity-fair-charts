[Intro]
It's the Dynasty, niggas... as promised
The world's most infamous
Roc-A-Fella Records
This is Roc La Familia
It's Young Hova, Beanie Sigel, Memphis Bleek, Amil-lion
It's the Dynasty, niggas, 2000 to infinity
This is ghetto to ghetto, gutter to gutter
Street corner to street corner, project to project
Worldwide, walk with us niggas
Hoffa, Dash, it's the Dynasty niggas
Check it out
Uhh, walk with me, talk to me, yo

[Verse 1]
The theme song to The Sopranos
Plays in the key of life on my mental piano
Got a strange way of seeing life like
I'm Stevie Wonder with beads under the doo-rag
Intuition is there even when my vision's impaired, yeah
Knowing I can go, just switching a spare
On the highway of life, nigga it's sharp in my sight
Oh! Keen senses ever since I was a teen on the benches
Every time somebody like Ennis was mentioned
I would turn green, me, being in the trenches
Him, living adventureous, not worrying about expenditures
I'm braving temperatures below zero, no hero
No father figure, you gotta pardon a nigga
But I'm starving, my niggas, and the weight loss in my figure
Is starting to darken my heart, 'bout to get to my liver
Watch it my niggas, I'm trying to be calm but I'm gon' get richer
Through any means, with that thing that Malcolm palmed in the picture
Never read the Qu'ran or Islamic scriptures
Only psalms I read was on the arms of my niggas
Tattooed so I carry on like I'm non-religious
Clap whoever stand between Shawn and figures
Niggas say it's the dawn, but I'm superstitious
Shit is as dark as it's been, nothing has gone as you predicted
I move with biscuits, stop the heart of niggas acting too suspicious
This is food for thought -- you do the dishes
