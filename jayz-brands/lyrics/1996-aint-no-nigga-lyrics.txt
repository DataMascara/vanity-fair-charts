[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I keep it fresher than the next, bitch
No need for you to ever sweat the next bitch
With speed, I make the best bitch see the exit indeed
You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me
You get the keys to the Lexus, with no driver
You got your own '96 something to ride
And keep your ass tight up in Versace, that's why
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me
They conniving, shit, the first chance to crack the bank
They try me, all they get is 50 cent franks
And papayas, from the village to the telly
Time to kill it on your belly no question
I got more black chicks between my sheets than Essence
They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less than 8 seconds
Still pounding in my after life
Laughing, my shit is tight
Who you asking right

[Hook: ? & ?]
Ain't no nigga like the one I got
No one can fuck you better
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
Keeps you in diamonds and leathers
Friends will tell me I should leave you alone
Hah hah, hah hah, hah hah, hah hah
Tell the freaks to find a man of their own
(Man of their own, man of their own)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Fresh to death in Moschino coach bag
Looking half black and Filipino faking no jacks
Got you a beeper to feel important
Surrounding your feet in Joan & David and Charles Jourdan
I keep you dove but love
You know these hoes be making me weak
Y'all knows how it goes b and so I creep
I've been sinning since you been playing with Barbie and Ken and
You can't change a players game in the 9th inning
The chrome rim spinning keeps them grinning
So I run way the fuck up in them
And wrinkle the face like linen
I play hard until they say "God
He's keeping it real Jigga stay hard"
Lord, don't even trip
I never slip, nigga, get a grip
What you don't see is what you get
Weapons concealed what the fuck y'all feel
When you niggas play sick we can all get ill
What the deal? (Foxy Brown)

[Hook: ? & ?]

[Jay-Z]
Yo, ain't no stopping this, no lie
Promise to stay monogamous, I try
But love you know these ho's be making me weak
Y'all know how it goes B so I stay deep

[Verse 3: Foxy Brown]
What up boo just keep me laced in the illest snakes
Bank rolls and shit, back rubs in the french tubs
Macking this bitch, wifee nigga
So when you flip that coke
Remember the days you was dead broke
But now you style and I raised you
Basically made you into a don
Flipping weight, heroin and shit
You know the pussy is all that
That's why I get baguettes, 5 carats and all that
From Dolce Gabana to H Bendel I'm ringing bells
So who the player, I still keep you in the illest gators
Tailor made so we can lay up in the shade reminiscing
On how I fuck the best and shit
Especially when I'm sipping Baileys
Don't give a fuck about how you move with them other mamis
I push the Z, eating shrimp scampi with rocks larger than life
Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who your wife was
I got you fronting in Armani sweaters, before this rap shit
When you was in leathers and bullshit berettas
And E classes with Mo in the glasses
Shows in Cali with all the flavor suede Bally's
Now all your mens is up in your Benz's
High post, I swear you be killing me
Playing inside my pubic hairs
I never worry about them other chicks
Cause you proved who was your wiz
When you was spending that bitch
I took a little when you was up north
Your commissary stay piling
How you living large on the island
All them collects have me vexed
But when you come home
Knew I was coming off with half of them checks
Now we on the rise
Your diamond mami with the slanted eyes
Holding this grip cocked the En Glee-Kay and shit
Fucks no, I see half of that dough
Made you into a star, pushing hundred thousand dollar cars

[Hook: ? & ?]
