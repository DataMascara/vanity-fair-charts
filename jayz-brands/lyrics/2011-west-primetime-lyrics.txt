[Intro: Jay-Z]
We in the time of our lives, baby
Turn the music up, primetime

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Primetime, beat by Dion
Our third eon, that's what the fuck we on
Mo' money, 40-year old phenom
My 15 minutes of fame is stretched beyond
At 42, be better than 24s
I carry the 4-5, mastered 48 laws
Still wearing my 23's, they can't fuck with the boy
Far as them 16's, I'm 23 of it all
Primetime, riding that 6 deuce
That 911, I only subtract the roof
Started in '88, got warm in '92
I landed in '96, that's the year I came through
I hit the club, order some Grey Goose
Switched it for Ciroc to give Puff's stocks a boost
New money, I found the fountain of youth
I'm heading to Miami to fuck up the Fontaine Bleau
A case of Ace.. make it 2
Nigga we rollin', beat the deuce
The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do

[Hook: Kanye West]
The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh?
The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do, huh?
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Primetime, basking in the lime
Cassius in his prime, coloring out of the line
Cause they don't want nobody that's colored out of the lines
So I'm late as a motherfucker, colored people time
Damn, Yeezy, it all gotta be dimes?
Well Adam gave up a rib, so mine better be prime
Niggas gonna kill me, I swear they better be lying
I never live in fear, I'm too out of my mind
Primetime, never hit these heights
I mean it's like, it's like our first first-class flight
I'm tripping on it, socks on marble floors, I'm slipping on it
Champagne I'm sipping on, the shit tastes different, don't it?
You know what? You right
It's like the best damn champagne I had in my life
"When you coming home?" That's a text from my wife
I told her run a bubble bath
And float in that motherfucker like a hovercraft
And soak in that motherfucker 'til I call you back
I mean, who says shit like that, and doesn't laugh?
Hah...

[Hook]
