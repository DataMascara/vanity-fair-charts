[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Nigga please, you ain't start out from your trunk
Then reach the roof, just to put your roof in your trunk
Nigga please, chumps don't tour like us
You on the road a million hours, I fly over your bus
Nigga please, you ain't got your neck all froze
With the same logo that you got sketched on your clothes
Nigga please, you don't be getting no hoes
With La Perla on they cheeks, can't be messin with cheap chicks
Nigga please, you seldom seen with chicks in 7 jeans
Manolo Blahnik, I'm goin through they body like an ultrasonic
You ain't got 'em blowin no chronic
Divine intervention, y'all can't prevent me from shinin
Nigga please, I been around the world
I damn near beat Jordan in around-the-world
Nigga please, you can't even hold my shoes
I got wannabes who wanna be me that sound better than you

[Verse Two: Jay-Z]
Ahhh! Pimp strollin on 'em
Black diamonds, rose goldin on 'em, paper foldin on 'em
Snuck pass the dog noses with the Folger's on 'em
Ki's, Saran Wrap with petroleum on 'em
Snitch got pinched but he told it on 'em
Lawyers got it adjourned, 'til I schools him on 'em
There's no witnesses, it's no holdin on 'em
Just George Jefferson strollin on 'em, uhh
Nigga please, this is me, this is real as it be

That boat, I had it on the Mediterranean sea
