[Intro: Jay-Z]
Told y'all
Dynasty, Roc-A-Fella Records you heard me
Unstoppable, niggas
Memph Bleek, Amillion, Sigel Sigel ya heard
It's a Dynasty
Who do you believe

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Jigga Man, mo' better, mo' cheddar
Foes knock the man off your Polo sweater
Roll with the R-O-C, A-Fella
Remember me
The teachers used to fail us
Now it's more scrilla, ho killers
Fo'-wheelers, we gorillas
Oh please feel us we heat holders
Fighting
Listen boy, Roy Jones couldn't steal us
The plot thickens, the block clicking
We got the game tied up, stop tripping
Jigga Man huh
Sigel Sigel y'all
Memph Bleek what
Amil-lion
Cat be him, El Cap-i-tan
The fire I spit burn down Happyland
Social Club, we unapproachable thugs
Non-social, gone postal
Great aim, harm the arm close to your toast
Like a Don's supposed to Shawn
I thought I told you, these ain't just vocals
Don't make me take it to the old school
I put holes through your hoes too
Through your clothes to the foes to the nigga close to you
Fuck it Jigga Man, Sigel Sigel y'all
Amillion what, Memph Bleek

[Memphis Bleek]
Y'all dudes don't get it, come widdit
Fifth loaded with slugs that'll rest in your fitted
It's M dot E-M, the Roc be them
Got the mami's saying look, who can stop be them
You wanna press your dumb luck, get blam blam-ed up
I crush your larynx, you talk about us nigga
No obituary, I get it critical
You know Memph'll hit the pall bearer lifting you
When I cock the plastic, make em drop the casket
When it's hot, I'm blasting
It's the Roc, you bastards
Jigga Man what, Amil-lion yeah
Memph Bleek huh, Sigel Sigel c'mon
Spit acid, c'mon
Witcha bullshit smash hit
Get your bullshit smashed in
Niggas wanna front and get jumped
Bet the Ruger give your right side a nice-sized lump
Nigga, we are, the supreme squad
You can dream hard but reality is
We push the dream cars
Fuck the queen broads
Puff the green raw, we as real as it get
We the R-O-C dot A dot Fellas
Bitches don't talk to us the hoes they e-mail us
Nigga Jigga Man what, Memph Bleek huh
Amillion yeah, Sigel Sigel rap

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
R (dot) O (dot) C (dot) stop
From Tower to ma and pop, I move out stop
Shower your mom block, move out with Glocks
Raw to the cook, look, move out them blocks
Take it to the bucks who be grinding it up
Usually take it to the dubs so they diamond it up
Competition, lining em up
Forty-five ACP, let me squeeze lime em up
You want, drama what
Well silence it up
Since a young buck
Violent as fuck
Wasn't me dog
The high will do it
I used to wild off embalming fluid
I sent niggas to the trauma unit
Forty-five or the nine'll do it
I fuck around and have your moms go through it
I'm a beast
Shit, niggas always wanna ye shit
Then they wanna cease shit
When they motherfucking peeps hit
But I don't cease nothing, I decease someone
I fuck around and have you sleeping underneath som'un
Jigga Man huh, Sigel Sigel y'all
Memph Bleek what, Amillion, uhh

[Verse 4: Amil]
Yo, A to the M-I, feminist
Holding the semi
Leave niggas faced with a dilemmi
Am I gonna run or stay, can I
Get away no you can't can't I surrendi
And I lazy bop, Mercedes hot
In my way through the tunnel like Lady Di

[Jay-Z]
Jigga Man huh, Sigel Sigel y'all
Memph Bleek what, Amillion, uhh
