"This is the operator with a collect call from: 'Emory Jones'
To accept the charges, press one now"

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
Emory, whattup?
Told you I ain't too good with writin' letters and all
Shit, I don't even write rhymes
But what I will do
I'mma send you this open scribe through the airwaves
Vibe with me...
Yeah, nigga, I bet we was kids and had dreams of bein' here
I said "we" cause I'm here, you here!
Yeah, ride with me, your spot is reserved family
Cigarette boats, yachts, ain't nowhere we can't go
We in South Beach and the Hamptons, too, baby!

[Hook: John Legend]
I know, I know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
I know, I know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
Do you wanna ride with me
Do you wanna ride with me

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
You know why they call The Projects a project, because it's a project!
An experiment, we're in it, only as objects
And the object for us to explore our prospects
And sidestep cops on the way to the top - yes!
As kids we would daydream, sittin on our steps
Pointin at cars like yeah that's our six
Hustlers, prophets, made our eyes stretch
So on some Dr. Spock shit, we STARted our TREK
Some of us made it, most of us digressed
In the name of those who ain't make it my progress
Is your success, please live through me
See I'm the eyes for Emory, keep him alive
(This is a collect call) So everytime I press five
All he wanna hear is his boy talk fly
Up in the fed, and still holdin his head
So when he hits the streets he gon' eat through this bread
Now let's ride

[Hook]

[Jay-Z - over Hook]
I'm crushin all award shows
MTV, BET, the Grammys, crushed linen, Purple Label

Uh-huh... tried to told you, ride with me

[Jay-Z]

Would deliver me, kingpin of the inkpen
Monster of the double entendre, Coke is still my sponsor
Heh, the Cola, yeah
Hova still gettin it in with soda
Diet, no sir, I ain't lose no weight
Started from the crates now I'm sittin on a whole case
Since they got you sittin on that old case
Our dreams is on hold like Tivo
So I can't wait 'til you get your date
I got some temp plates outside of the gate
We gon' ride
